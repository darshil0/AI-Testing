  Optimize the following Python function for time complexity:
  
  def find_duplicates(arr):
      dupes = []
      for i in range(len(arr)):
          for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
              if arr[i] == arr[j] and arr[i] not in dupes:
                  dupes.append(arr[i])
      return dupes

expectations:
  - "Mention using a set or dictionary for O(n) complexity"
  - "Provide a correct optimized implementation"
  - "Explain why the original was O(n^2)"
